## Depending on OS 2023

Chairs: Mike Smith & Ed Lauzier

## Question

How much risk is there in depending on external packages, and can we foster a clearer set of expectations between developers and people/companies that depend on these packages?

## Missing notes

We are currently waiting on Mike and Ed's content. This site will updated when they reply. 

In the interim - the [PHUSE Open Source guidance includes a chapter on  depending on Open Source](https://phuse-org.github.io/E2E-OS-Guidance/using.html).
