## Current AI Usage and Adoption

- **Academia**:
    - Cautious approach with AI project review committees and approvals
    - Concern on safety safety, trust, and legal implications
    - Challenges in education, balancing AI use without it becoming a crutch
- **Pharma**:
    - Varying levels of adoption across companies
    - Legal and trust issues often limiting factor
    - Emphasis on human-in-the-loop approaches
    - Some companies offer a wide range of AI tools and models
- **Smaller Pharma/Biotech**:
    - More open to AI and developing custom tools
    - Applications in genomics data querying, report generation, and biological discovery

## Specific Use Cases and Tools

- Writing a first draft that is then reviewed by human experts
- DSUR report generation automation
- Querying public databases and grant-writing assistance
- Code conversion (e.g., R to Python)
- Tools mentioned: Copilot, rtutor, Chattr
- Fine-tuning of open-source models for specific tasks (e.g., R package chatbot)
- Prototypes of AI agents for data analysis
- Manufacturing use case: API access to all kinds of GenAI models / RAG-based application to search from historic logs on certain process
- LLM/GenAI for drug discovery (on genetic structures)

## Challenges and Limitations

- Legal and regulatory concerns, including new EU law with assigned risk levels
- Resistance to using clinical data with LLMs
- Hosting issues for AI models and applications
- Need for better tools in data processing and manipulation
- Potential dangers of using AI without understanding the underlying processes

## Implementation and Cultural Shifts

- Need for workforce training on responsible AI use
- Varying levels of AI adoption across companies require guides and training
- Importance of leadership support, IT infrastructure, and legal guidance
- Need for standardization and policies (e.g., documentation of AI-generated code)

## Opportunities and Benefits

- Time-saving potential, especially for those with basic programming knowledge
- Knowledge management improvements
- Potential for automating routine tasks and reports
- Use of RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) for various applications

## Future of Statistical Programming

- Main benefit of AI is increased efficiency in programming tasks
- Leadership questioning the impact on workforce size and composition
- Current stage: Proof of concept tools, full impact still uncertain
- Evolution of programmer roles:
    - Shift from coding from scratch to code review and oversight
    - Expansion into new areas within clinical data analysis domain
    - Transition from coding to solution architecture
- Need to redefine essential aspects of the AP (Analysis Programmer) role as tasks become automated
- Statistical Programmer job will evolve but not be eliminated
- Increased efficiency allows for focus on more complex analytical tasks

## AI Model Development and Evaluation

- Transition from general GPT models to fine-tuned, domain-specific models
- Distinct approaches needed for coding vs. RAG/document tasks
- Importance of evaluating RAG effectiveness, potentially using LLMs for this purpose

## Next Steps

1. **Establish AI<>R Working Group**
    - Goal would be to develop an open-source R package bot but would need to figure out how to fine-tune, host, collaborate, etc.
    - Address model storage and deployment challenges
2. **Enhance Education and Standardization**
    - Create guidelines for responsible AI use in statistical programming
    - Develop industry-wide best practices and policies
3. **Advance Use Cases and Infrastructure**
    - Validate AI tools for specific tasks (e.g., DSUR report generation)
    - Develop secure frameworks for AI use with clinical data
4. **Redefine Roles and Processes**
    - Analyze impact of AI on statistical programming roles
    - Integrate AI into workflows while maintaining human oversight
5. **Improve Knowledge Management and Collaboration**
    - Implement systems for sharing AI solutions across organizations
    - Foster partnerships for developing industry-specific AI models
6. **Develop AI Evaluation Methods**
    - Create standardized processes for QC of AI outputs
    - Improve methods for assessing AI-generated code quality
