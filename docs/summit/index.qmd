## Purpose

Our summit builds on one of the initial goals of R/Pharma - to bring people together in a room and start the conversations.  The first two years of R/Pharma were solely in-person events where amazing work was discussed, sparking industry initiatives.  When we moved to online conferences, the benefit of face-to-face interaction was lost.  The R/Pharma Summit brings it back.

Each year we host a face-to-face summit as posit::conf, bringing thought leaders and decision makers together in a room to discuss all things open source and Pharma.  The notes taken, and any actions, are shared with the community.
