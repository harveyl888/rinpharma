There is much excitement for R/Pharma in the second half of the year! Please find below the plan for our in-person Summit and Virtual gathering!

## genAI Day

R/Pharma is hosting the second annual, free one-day event, highlighting the use of generative AI in the Pharma industry.  Registration is available via this [link](https://events.zoom.us/ev/AhJgNAEgFp0gVZG2EFBctyctEm8CstaLIEhxRlQMdtnGW3kbCTuI~ArOl6K2ZzYqVlcryttKbAVtgnsvE6g6mByAhuOim9_vxpcQ-lh-mJvL1Ag).  
The meeting will run from 10:00AM-3:00PM ET on August 19th, with talks focusing on applications of generative AI for drug development activities and on the use as a coding aid for programmers.  Speakers and schedule will be announced shortly.

## In-Person Summit

R/Pharma is excited to announce that we are partnering again with Posit PBC to host our in-person program at posit::conf(2025), happening at the Hyatt Regency Seattle. The Summit will be on Monday Sep 15th 2025. The Summit can be booked via the posit::conf(2025) registration page: [https://posit.co/blog/register-for-r-pharma-at-posit-conf-2025/](https://posit.co/blog/register-for-r-pharma-at-posit-conf-2025/).

The Summit can be booked independently of posit::conf(2025), or bundled with a posit::conf(2025) ticket, workshop or both.

The R/Pharma Summit will highlight how open-source tools are shaping the future of drug development. Throughout the event, facilitators will guide in-person discussions with industry leaders on key topics including reproducibility, regulatory submissions, and scalability, all with an emphasis on advancing next-generation submissions through the use of open-source solutions.

Topics for roundtable summit discussions are sourced from the community.  Feel free to add suggestions, comment and upvote [here](https://github.com/rinpharma/rinpharma-summit-2025/discussions), even if you are unable to attend the summit.

In addition to the summit, there will be two R/Pharma workshops at posit::conf on Tuesday Sep 16th.

#### End-to-End Submissions in R with the Pharmaverse. 
**Daniel Sjoberg (Genetech) and Becca Krouse (GSK)**  
A hands-on introduction to using R and Pharmaverse packages for a streamlined regulatory submission process, covering data preparation, CDISC compliance, and TLG generation. Participants will learn to optimize their workflow from raw data to publication-ready outputs.

#### Deploying Reproducible Analytics Environments for Regulated Use Cases  
**James Black (Novartis), Orla Doyle (Novartis), and Doug Kelkhoff (Roche)**  
This workshop addresses the challenges and opportunities of deploying reproducible R analytical environments in regulated industries. Through a mix of discussions and exercises, the workshop will focus on containerization, package management, compliance, and sharing with regulators.
