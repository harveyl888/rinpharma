## CALLING ALL OPEN SOURCE DEVELOPERS

The R/Pharma Expo is an opportunity to show off your awesome work!  Do you contribute to open source by building packages or sharing shiny apps?  Do you share content through a podcast or YouTube channel? We're excited to announce that R/Pharma 2025 will feature a virtual expo hall where you can showcase what you do.  
The expo will run continuously from November 3-7, throughout the R/Pharma conference, giving people a chance to wander through virtual booths and interact with other attendees.  You can even share demos and chat to people via Zoom.

If you want to take part then there's a few things that we'll need:

  -  title and description of package, podcast, etc.
  -  a short video (up to 5 minutes) as an MP4 or YouTube link and some images or screen captures (all optional).
  -  website and social media links (optional).

**We'll set up the booth for you.  All you need to do is provide the information**
