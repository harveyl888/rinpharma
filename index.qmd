## R/Pharma Summit

The R/Pharma summit has run for three years at posit::conf.  In 2025, over 100 representatives from 40+ companies met in-person to discuss some of the most pressing topics pharma is tackling.  The in-person summit focuses on the future of drug development using open source and tailored for program leaders and people leading Open Source initiatives. A summary of prior years is here: [Summit page](/docs/summit). 

Throughout the 2025 R/Pharma Summit, facilitators fostered in-person discussions and conversations about key items (reproducibility, interactivity, submissions, scalability, etc.) with industry leaders about open-source tools for next-generation submissions.The advisory board, shaping the agenda and planned actions for the event, spans >10 pharma companies, as well as CROs and academic research centers.

## Community

### Diversity Alliance

We aspire to be an inclusive R community for developers who work in the pharma space. Our goal is to provide a welcoming, equitable and supportive space for people to upskill, share knowledge and build a community of diverse voices. The R/Pharma **Diversity Alliance** is a space where all ways of being and doing can feel welcome.  Each year, the Diversity Alliance put on a hackathon to introduce new voices to open source R package development.  For more details subscribe to our [meeting calendar](https://www.addevent.com/calendar/AD808454) or email us at [diversityalliance@opensourceinpharma.com](mailto:diversityalliance@opensourceinpharma.com).

### R/Pharma Hangouts
