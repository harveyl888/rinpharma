# Diversity

# Policy Statement of the R/Pharma Conference and other events hosted by Open Source in Pharma
The purpose of the R/Pharma conference is to foster discussion on the use of R in the pharmaceutical industry. R/Pharma is not, and hopefully never will be a commercially oriented meeting. As such, we do not accept administrative responsibility for distributing commercial materials, nor do we allow vendors to participate in the meeting in any role other than as scientists/practitioners interested in learning or discussing the application of R in Pharma. All attendees are requested to adhere to the spirit of this policy. Please don’t spam attendees.
